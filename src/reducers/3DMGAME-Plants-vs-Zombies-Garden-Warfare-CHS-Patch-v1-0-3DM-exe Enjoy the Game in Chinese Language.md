Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare is a popular third-person shooter game that features plants and zombies as the main factions. The game was released in 2014 for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox 360. However, the game does not have an official Chinese language option, which may be disappointing for some players who prefer to play in their native language.

Luckily, there is a way to install a Chinese patch for Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, thanks to the efforts of a group called 3DM. 3DM is a Chinese hacking group that is known for cracking various games and releasing them for free. They have also created a Chinese patch for Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, which can be downloaded from their website or other sources.
 
The patch is called 3DMGAME-Plants-vs-Zombies-Garden-Warfare-CHS-Patch-v1-0-3DM-exe and it is compatible with the latest version of the game. The patch will replace the English text and voice with Chinese ones, making the game more accessible and enjoyable for Chinese players.
 
To install the patch, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the patch file from 3DM's website or other sources. The file size is about 1.5 GB.
2. Extract the patch file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called Plants.vs.Zombies.Garden.Warfare.CHS.Patch.v1.0-3DM.
3. Copy the contents of the folder and paste them into your game directory, where you have installed Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. You may need to overwrite some files.
4. Run the game and enjoy it in Chinese.

Note that this patch is unofficial and may not work properly with future updates or online features of the game. Use it at your own risk and discretion.
