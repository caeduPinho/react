Do you want to make your computer faster, more secure, and more reliable? If so, you might be interested in Dataram RAMDisk, a software that creates a virtual disk drive using your system memory. RAMDisk is a program that takes a portion of your system memory and uses it as a disk drive. The more RAM your computer has, the larger the RAMDisk you can create[^4^].

What is the benefit of using RAMDisk? In a word: SPEED! The performance of a RAMDisk, in general, is orders of magnitude faster than other forms of storage media, such as an SSD (up to 100X) and hard drive (up to 200X)[^4^]. You can use RAMDisk to speed up applications like:
 
- Games
- Browser cache for faster web surfing
- Audio and video editing
- CAD programs
- Software compilers
- Databases
- TEMP files
- Swap space
- Web server cache
- Security- all information can be wiped upon power loss or shutdown
- Custom applications with high I/O, high bandwidth, or high security requirements

An additional feature of a RAMDisk is that it will never wear out. You can access it at maximum bandwidth 24/7/365 without fear of mechanical failure, or fragmentation[^4^]. A RAMDisk operating at maximum bandwidth does not produce excessive heat, noise or vibrations. RAMDisk can also out-perform solid state disks (SSDs)[^4^].
 
Dataram RAMDisk has been in the market for over 14 years and is in use globally at thousands of enterprise sites. It has over 2 million installs and climbing, and is the software of choice for datacenter applications[^4^]. You can download RAMDisk for free for personal use only, or purchase a commercial license starting at just $39 USD[^4^]. You can also get RAMDisk Extreme, which unlocks the freeware and enables features such as Background Update[^4^]. This option greatly reduces time to shut down RAMDisk by keeping the RAMDisk backed up continuously. This is also great for data protection as the RAMDisk \*.img file is as up to date as possible at any given time[^4^].

## How to Set Up a RAMDisk with Dataram RAMDisk
 
One of the most popular and easy-to-use software for creating a RAMDisk is Dataram RAMDisk. You can download it from [http://memory.dataram.com/products-and-services/software/ramdisk](http://memory.dataram.com/products-and-services/software/ramdisk). The installation process is straightforward and you can choose to include all the components. After installing the software, you can follow these steps to create your RAMDisk:

1. Double-click on the desktop icon labeled âRamDisk Configuration.â
2. Adjust the disk size in the box at the top of the window. We recommend at least 4GB of storage to get a feel for how the disk works. Click âOKâ at the bottom of the window. This will create your RAMDisk, which is just a virtual disk thatâs assigned to your computerâs RAM. The process happens transparently, so thereâs nothing you need to do[^1^].
3. If you get a warning about shutdown settings, click on the âShutdown settingsâ button. Then unlock the settings pane with your administrator password. Finally, uncheck the checkbox next to âTurn on fast startup (recommended)â and click âSave changesâ at the bottom of the window[^1^]. This will allow ImDisk to save your RAMDiskâs data to an image file when you shut down your computer, and load it back when you start up.
4. Your RAMDisk is now ready for use. You can access and use it just like any normal hard drive. It shows up in Windows File Explorer just like any other drive[^1^].

## How to Use Your RAMDisk Effectively
 
Now that you have created your RAMDisk, you might wonder how to use it effectively. Here are some tips and suggestions:

- Move your browser cache to your RAMDisk. This will speed up your web surfing and reduce the wear and tear on your hard drive or SSD. To do this, you need to change the settings in your browser to point to a folder on your RAMDisk. For example, in Firefox, you can go to Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data > Manage Data > Change Location and select a folder on your RAMDisk[^1^].
- Install programs that you use frequently on your RAMDisk. This will make them load faster and run smoother. To do this, you need to copy the program files from your hard drive or SSD to your RAMDisk, and then create shortcuts or change registry entries to point to the new location. For example, if you want to move Word to your RAMDisk, you can copy the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE to your RAMDisk, and then create a shortcut on your desktop or taskbar that points to R:\WINWORD.EXE (assuming R is your RAMDisk letter)[^1^].
- Use your RAMDisk for temporary files or swap space. This will reduce the clutter and fragmentation on your hard drive or SSD, and improve the performance of some applications that rely on temporary files or swap space. To do this, you need to change the settings in Windows or in specific applications to use a folder on your RAMDisk for temporary files or swap space. For example, in Windows 10, you can go to Settings > System > About > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Performance > Settings > Advanced > Virtual memory > Change and select a custom size for your RAMDisk[^1^].
