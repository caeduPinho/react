One of the main highlights of PES 2013 is the new control system, called PES FullControl, which gives players more freedom and flexibility to dribble, pass, shoot and trap the ball. Players can also customize their own playing style and adjust the speed and direction of their movements. PES 2013 also introduces PlayerID, a system that recreates the physical features and skills of the world's best soccer players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar and more. Players can enjoy the realistic animations and behaviors of their favorite stars on the pitch.
 
PES 2013 also boasts a refined AI engine, called ProActive AI, which enhances the balance between attack and defense, and improves the responsiveness and intelligence of the players and teams. The game also offers various modes and options to suit different preferences and tastes. Players can play online or offline, solo or with friends, in tournaments or leagues, or even create their own custom teams and players.
 
PES 2013 is a classic soccer game that delivers a satisfying and authentic experience for fans of the sport.

PES 2013 is not without its flaws, however. The game still suffers from some technical issues, such as occasional glitches, slowdowns and graphical errors. The commentary is also repetitive and bland, and the soundtrack is forgettable. The online mode is also not very stable, and it can be hard to find a match or connect with other players. The game also lacks some of the licenses and features that its rival FIFA has, such as the official Champions League and Europa League tournaments, or the Ultimate Team mode.
 
Despite these drawbacks, PES 2013 is a game that deserves a chance from soccer fans who are looking for a different and challenging experience. The game offers a deep and rewarding gameplay that rewards skill and strategy over luck and randomness. The game also has a loyal and passionate fan base that creates and shares various mods and patches to enhance the game's content and quality.
